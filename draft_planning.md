This is a draft of a possible planning of the year 2025-2026, with the UMCG project in mind.

The UMCG project is a longer running project, with the goal of developing models that can predict the outcome of fractures (risk of complications).

We want to split the year into 4 main parts, possibly not overlapping with quarter boundaries (the periods usually maintained by the TU Delft).

I've divided everything in periods, as it doesn't have to align with the quarter boundaries. But for imagery, you can imagine period n to be the n-th quarter of the year.

In period 0 (the summer):
- Contacting hospitals, gathering anonimized data.

In period 1:
- Keep gathering data.
- A practice competition. Try to keep the competition that you use to practice, as close as possible to the competition that you plan to host (image data, order of 200-2000 images, ideally in the medical domain). The closer to your target, the better the transferability of your knowledge.
    
    Goals: 
    - Win the competition.
    - Explore as many ideas as possible.

In period 2:
- Keep gathering data.
- Prepare the competition. Iterate over metrics. You need a metric that when optimized, corresponds as well as possible to what you're trying to achieve. Do the competition as you would normally to find as many errors as you can, and iron them out. 
- Publicize what you are doing to the TU Delft community. Host a hackathon, hold lecture talks, post on socials, hang up posters, etc.
- Publicize what you are doing outside of the TU Delft community. Get on radio shows with the message "this is how you can contribute to a better world from your own home!", have clear introductions on the site of what ML competitions are and how to get started to make it accessible to as many people as possible.
- Contact a competition hosting platform.

In period 3:
- Host the competition.
- For the best results, compete yourself, and share your findings.
- Constantly monitor the state of the competition, and be quick to react to any problems.

In period 4:
- Further develop the best solutions, compare them, possibly ensemble them further.
- Make code that runs the model in an accessible way, as usable as possible for UMCG.
- Actively assist UMCG in their work to get everything up and running as quickly as possible (ideally the model can already be tested by them in some way).
- Hand over everything you've learned to the next team, keep the collaboration of solving this problem going.
